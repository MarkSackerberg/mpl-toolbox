# Metaplex Candy Machine v3

This is a test repository that aims to provide an example on how to manage
programs, idls and client generation for any number of programs in a single
"product" repository.

This particular example contains 2 programs:
- Candy Machine Core
- Candy Guard

The autogenerated clients aggregate all these programs into a single client.
